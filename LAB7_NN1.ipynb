    "There are many regularization methodologies that can be useful in training Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L1/L2 Regularization**: These add penalty terms to the loss function based on the weights of the model. L1 regularization (LASSO) encourages sparsity, while L2 (Ridge) regularization penalizes large weights.\n",
    "- **Dropout**: A technique where during training, random neurons are dropped out, i.e., set to zero, with a certain probability. This helps prevent overfitting by ensuring the model doesn't rely too heavily on any particular neuron.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping**: A technique where training stops if the validation loss stops improving for a specified number of epochs, helping to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization**: This normalizes the output of each layer so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps speed up training and can improve performance.\n",
